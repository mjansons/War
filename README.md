Game flow:

1. The Deck is shuffled
2. The deck is divided in half among the players.
   - War can also be played by multiple people. Each player in a three-player game receives 17 cards, while each person in a four-player game receives 13.
3. Each player reveals the top card of their deck

4. the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to the bottom of their stack.

   - If the two highest cards played are of equal value, then all players (go to war) place the next card from their pile face down and then another card face-up. The owner of the higher face-up card wins and adds all the cards on the table to the bottom of their deck.
     - If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's or one runs out of cards.

5. game continues until everyone except one player runs out of cards
